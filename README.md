<sup>1</sup>: Appears to be broken on Linux due to an issue where btleplug never
correctly recieves the dbus property-change message which notifies it that a
connection has been established, even though "Connected" and "Services Resolved"
are displayed in `bluetoothctl`. I'm guessing this is a locking issue involving
the CondVar, or something like that?

## Protocol docs

WerWolv's [blog post](https://werwolv.net/blog/cat_printer) contains initial docs from RE of the Android app, however more is now known.

TODO: describe connecting to the printer using BLE

The commands used to communicate with the printer are described in [this document.](COMMANDS.md)

## Hardware

Four different model names (included in bluetooth advertisements) have been observed:

### GB01
#### Known owners
+ WerWolv (blue)
+ Iris (blue)
+ amber-sixel (pink)

#### Internal photos
See [WerWolv's blog post](https://werwolv.net/blog/cat_printer).

#### Notable components
+ JL MCU with built-in Bluetooth (model number not clearly readable)

### GB02
#### Known owners
+ the6p4c (pink)

#### Internal photos

| Front (assembled) | Back |
|---|---|
| ![1](photos/the6p4c/image0.jpg) | ![2](photos/the6p4c/image1.jpg) |

#### Notable components
+ JL MCU with built-in Bluetooth (model number not clearly readable)

### GT01
#### Known owners
+ JJJollyjim (pink)
+ xssfox (pink)

#### Internal photos

| Front (assembled) | Back | JL Chip (closeup) |
|---|---|---|
| ![1](photos/jjjollyjim/1.jpg) | ![2](photos/jjjollyjim/2.jpg) | ![3](photos/jjjollyjim/3.jpg) |

#### Notable components
+ JL MCU with built-in Bluetooth. Markings: JL BP02989-56C4

#### USB Behaviour
Does not enumerate. Data lines are routed, however. perhaps it's used for programming, as described [here](https://github.com/christian-kramer/JieLi-AC690X-Familiarization)?

### YHK-C200 

#### Known owners
+ Stary2001 (blue)

#### Internal photos

| Front (assembled)         | Back                    | Back (closeup)          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| ![1](photos/stary/1.jpg) | ![2](photos/stary/2.jpg) | ![3](photos/stary/3.jpg) |

#### Notable components
+ GD32F303 (STM32 clone)
+ BARROT bluetooth module
+ Fentech SPI Flash
+ Unpopulated UART header

#### USB Behaviour
Enumerates as an HID device!

```
[15361.648980] usb 7-3: Product: Print-M200
[15361.648981] usb 7-3: Manufacturer: Pintron-M200
[15361.648982] usb 7-3: SerialNumber: pintronhid0000001
```

#### Other notes
"YHK" isn't a known printer type to blueUtils. It may use a completely different protocol.
